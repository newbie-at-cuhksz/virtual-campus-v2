Integration with Survival Engine:
1) Import Survival Engine first (v1.10+)
2) Import Dialogue and Quests
3) If there are no compile errors, the "Scripting Define Symbol" DIALOGUE_QUESTS should be added automatically to the player settings. If not add it manually. 
4) Make sure the DQManager prefab is in the scene, and that you add the Actor script to the PlayerCharacter! Then everything should work!
5) Optional but strongly recommended: Download the Demo package, it contains a demo scene to show how the two assets work together.

6) Open demo the scene in the DialogueQuestsDemo folder and try it!

Integration with InControl:
1) Import both assets
2) If there are no compile errors, the "Scripting Define Symbol" IN_CONTROL should be added automatically to the player settings. If not, add it manually.
3) Connect a USB gamepad such as Xbox One controller, and run the game!
